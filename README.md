# Trivia-Game
HQ trivia game spring boot project
# Requirements
- The application should run in completely automatic mode - i.e no admin intervention should be required to start the game (once a minimum number of players have joined) or advance the game to the next round.
- The application should allow running multiple games simultaneously.
- The application should allow a reasonably large number of players to participate in each game (think hundreds).
- The application should display statistics about player choices at the end of each round (how many players have chosen each answer).
